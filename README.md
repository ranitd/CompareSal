# CompareSal

I am a third year student in computer engineering.

CompareSal is a project I did as part of the "Software Engineering" course.

The project implements a comparison of shopping baskets in supermarkets according to the quality of the supermarkets that the costumers
rated and according to the cheapest price of the basket in a particular supermarket.

Each user can enter the site, create a basket of products, and the site will calculate for him where it is most profitable to buy
when the calculation algorithm gives a certain factor to the price and a certain factor to the quality so that the paid basket is
calculated according to both.

The project uses technologies such as java, jsp, servlet, html, css.
